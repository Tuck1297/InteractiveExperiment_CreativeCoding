## Project Overview

Creative coding is a concept where one moves away from creating a program for purposes of accomplishing a task. Instead it focuses on reflecting one's own perspective and thoughts throhgh their code. 
This project aimed at accomplishing these objectives by building a interaction based program that allows one to interact through taking in the musical graphic syncronization queues implemented by 
integrating the Web Audio API.

up to you to explore the settings of the internal binary code...
